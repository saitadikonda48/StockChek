<h1 class="text-align-center">About Us</h1><hr>
<p class="lead">This website is simply meant to help you analyze a stock. There are <em>two</em> types of techniques used to analyze a stock. The first is fundamental analysis. This is what this website provides you with. Using fundamental analysis means that you take a closer look at the company, its competitors, the industry itself, as well as the overall condition of the market. Technical analysis is the second type of analysis. It requires you to identify trends in the stock price. In other words yu look at a chart and try to identify trends that will indicate future growth. Technical analysis is commonly used be people who trade stock at higher frequencies. It can also be used for algorythmic trading: a process in which a computer is programed to buy and sell stock. Technical analysis is based on the idea that everything that you need to know about a stock is already accounted for in the price so you don't need to know anything else. Technical analysis is legitimate for many more reasons but this website provides only the tools for technical analysis. If you are interested in technical analysis than visit <a href="http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:john_murphy_s_ten_laws_of_technical_trading">this</a> website for more information. In addition to using our website to form your own analysis, we recommend you take a look at what analysts are saying abut the stock. Yahoo Finance is great for seeing what many analysts are saying. We hope you keep learning more and more about investing and most importantly <strong>do not invest more than you can afford to lose!</strong></p>
