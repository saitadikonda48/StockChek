## About the website
The website scrapes information of certain websites to obtain necessary financial information. It uses said information to perform calculations and show certain ratios, along with the significance of those ratios. In other words it performs __really basic__ fundamental analysis. This is a website built using the Django web framework. The UI sucks for it currently and I plan on eventually fixing it. I also removed several files from this github repository for security reasons.
